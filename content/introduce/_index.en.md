Zero Makes Zero, a public art project selected by Arts Council Korea in 2020, is a forum that examines the structure of the art scene and elevates a diverse array of voices. It captures the movements and actions of creators, citizens, and activists across systems and genres, learning about their attitudes and imagining the relocation of the meaning of public art.

<p class="font-jejumyeongjo leading-10">
Zero Difference: We pay attention to the gap found between the majority and the minority -- examining gaps between generations, genders, regions, and technological education from a public point of view, and finding ways to narrow them.

Zero Process: We read veganism, animal rights, and ecology in the black-boxed merchandising methods, and in works created under the name of art and search for disappeared beings.

<span class="font-semibold">Hwayong Kim</span> poses questions about identities created by stereotypes, customs, and ideologies, and has worked through methods such as encounters, travel, workshops, and performances to address concerns surrounding them, such as boundaries, diversity, and gender. Hwayong Kim is  currently exploring the possibility of political power and solidarity within those who organize life artistically rather than through art itself through a vegan perspective in which she is researching the exploitation of non-human species hidden behind the myths of culture & art. Hwayong developed the workshop program ‘GaOk: open space’, experimenting with the possibility of collaboration with experts outside the art scene, and worked as part of the Okin Collective, in which she contemplated the relationship and coexistence between society and art. Hwayong Kim has participated in exhibitions such as Earthbound (Amado Art Space, 2020), Korea Artist Prize 2018 (National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, 2018), Reenacting history: Collective Actions and Everyday Gestures (National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, 2017) and curated Go-vegan, Un-learning (BOAN1942, 2020) in addition to several other exhibitions.
